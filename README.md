# tmNIDS-Attacks-
# 🛡️ Continuous Attack Detection using tmNIDS

A practical demonstration of real-time continuous attack simulation and detection using **tmNIDS** (Traffic Monitoring Network Intrusion Detection System) integrated with **Splunk** for security analytics.

## 📘 Overview

This project simulates multiple attack vectors against a monitored network environment and visualizes them using tmNIDS and Splunk. It is designed for cybersecurity training, testing detection capabilities, and practicing log analysis under real-time attack scenarios.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ⚙️ Configuration and usage of tmNIDS
- 🔁 Continuous attack simulation using predefined identifiers
- 📊 Real-time traffic monitoring
- 🛠️ Splunk integration for log ingestion and visualization
- 📝 Alert generation and pattern analysis

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **tmNIDS** – Traffic Monitoring NIDS
- **Splunk** – SIEM for data analysis and visualization
- **Linux (Kali/Ubuntu)** – for attack simulation
- **Python/Shell scripts** – to automate attacks (optional)

## 📝 How It Works

1. **Directory Setup:** Locate and verify the tmNIDS directory.
2. **Environment Navigation:** Navigate to the tmNIDS path to begin attack simulation.
3. **Select Attack Pattern:** Choose attack type. `16` represents all available attacks.
4. **Start Enterprise Server:** Launch the monitoring server to collect logs.
5. **View Logs:** Observe real-time logs in Splunk as attacks are executed.
